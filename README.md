# Ansible Project for the AWS Cloudformation Exercise
This Ansible project was created for, and is therefore heavily dependant on,
[aws-cloudformation-exercise](https://github.com/gliech/aws-cloudformation-exercise).

The main focus of this project lays on the exchange of information between the
Cloudformation stack and Ansible, as well as the dynamic filtering of hosts in
the site.yml. The roles used here are neither complete nor secure and are meant
for demonstration purposes only!
